# Dev2Friend
A social media platform for developer to collaborate with each other and work towards a project with similar interests and goals.

The main purpose of this project is to allow computer science students from my university to group up with other students and work on a project of their interests. They can collaborate with each other and match their skills and knowledge towards a specific goal.
